                    The land of Ashes lays somewhere between a big ocean and a steep mountain. The world’s only town lies there, composed from the vastness of small houses. They are made from wood and colored glass and are built wall to wall so that nobody feels left out. The streets are very narrow. Walking around the city feels like going through a large labyrinth. While squeezing through endless facades you can get a glimpse of the inside — blankets covering floors and walls and visible heatwave coming from the fireplace. Mesmerized by the infinite lights you wander. It is hard not to get lost.
	                   The town of Ashes is inhabited by ghouls, who have been there since the dawn of time. They were never born and so they will never die. They are tall and slender, and their hair is dark, long, and shiny, almost as if they were born from willow trees. Their skin is a little transparent. Like a window on a cold day, steamy from the inside’s warmth.<sup>♱</sup>
            
                </p>            
                <p>
				    All of them love sex. Their desire for sexual pleasure gives them life. They feed on vital juices and those come only from sexual intercourse. Ghouls love it in every possible way — alone, in pairs, in groups. There is lust in the air. Strolling through the narrow streets, one has to squeeze through sweaty, hot bodies arranged in different kinds of combinations. On the pavements, at the walls, in the windows, on the windows, inside of the houses. It’s impossible to not be stopped or stop and not to be lost in the desire. In the world of the Ashes, even though there are dicks and vaginas, they exist only as body parts. Having one or another never determined anything.The imagination of the Ghouls is infinite and as old as time, and nobody ever gave a second thought to    dicks and vaginas.
                    Ghouls are an extremely loving and caring community. They cannot get pregnant, since they were never born in the first place, so their care is placed within their already existing relationships.<sup>♱♱</sup>

				    <sup>♱</sup> On 25th of October 2015 parliamentary elections in Poland ended with the victory of Law and Justice party.<sup>1</sup> The party promised improvement of the life quality and general change in approach, which met the demands of society at that time. Over the years new government was implementing a lot of changes, which core was mostly to elevate importance of family and religion. This rise of religious influences made Church become inseparable institution of decision making. Over the years the conservative, ruling party became direct and violent towards any oppositionists, getting radical in its misogynist, racist, homophobic and xenophobic narration. Immigrants, women, and LGBTQIA+ people were treated all together as a threat to the country’s future. Radical new laws implemented over this groups became a start to the enormous, political war inside of the country to fight together for equal rights and a brighter future.<br>
                    Vampires are those who have always been there. They are the people who have been pushed out from society, due to their different behaviors of physical features, which were outside of societal norms. In Poland, everyone who stands on the opposition to the government’s ideology is treated either with hate, negligence or violence.

				    <sup>♱♱</sup> Vampire both attracts and repels people. It is a response to the fear of death and the horror of the decay of the human body. Vampire also appears in a sexual dimension. A reference comes from a Polish theorist Maria Janion. It is an expression of hidden sexual desires and fantasies, in particular those stigmatized by social sexual norms such as homosexuality or BDSM practices. The vampire represents what is forbidden, standing in opposition to Christian beliefs. Its habit of drinking blood, which is to ensure his earthly immortality, is a reversal of the meanings of the sacrament of the Eucharist.<sup>2</sup>

                <p>  
                    One night in the smallest house of the town, one of the Ghouls named Apolonia was looking at themself in the mirror. They noticed something just next to the surface of their belly. A black dot, just as big as a thumbnail. Scared by their body changing, Apolonia locked themself inside of their home. It was not an embarrassing situation. They felt the urge to explore what was coming next. The days passed in isolation. They pleasured themselves all day, sang songs, and worried all the time. Day by day the dot grew bigger and bigger. They felt drained and weak. Like any other, they needed to feed, and so they went out. While they were strolling on the street some of their fellow creatures started to notice. Their looks were surprised, curious. Some stopped to ask. A second later there was a big crowd surrounding Apolonia, everyone wanting to ask and touch their belly. Soon everyone from the whole town gathered around them.</p>
                    <p>Ghouls never wore any clothes. As a community, they never experienced anything like shame. Some of them were shy, but that always came from respect for others, and not from the feeling of being judged. Their bodies were all different but never objectified. This was a first time they’ve seen a body growing inside of another. They never experienced anything similar. An abstraction with no precedent. Ghouls never had problems with communication. Obvious truths were instilled inside each one of them and have never been broken.</p>
                    <p>Some people started to talk. First silently in the background, and then as more and more voices joined the conversation, the tension began to grow. The massive cacophony of voices turned into a heated fight. The scream was so unbearable to Apolonia, that they started to crawl on their knees through the crowd, experiencing fear for the very first time. They barely made it a few meters into the crowd, when they suddenly felt that they were being pulled away from the ground. Keep it! Miracle! Stop it! Keep it! Keep it! Stop it! Miracle! Harm! Keep it! Keep it! Stop it! Keep it! Miracle! Stop it! Keep it! Keep it! Stop it! Miracle! Harm! Keep it! Keep it! Stop it! Harm! Harm! Harm! And a miracle happened. The thing inside of Apolonia’s belly moved and suddenly the land of Ashes experienced a shift of power like never before. The Ghouls began arguing and split into two groups. One group wanted the thing to be taken out instantly, to make sure that it will cause no harm, while the other wanted to keep it and see how it evolves. The move from words to deeds came shortly. Instead of kissing, they started to kick, slap and beat the others. Few Ghouls grabbed Apolonia with force, and just before anybody knew it they were gone. They took them to one of the small houses. They guarded the place during the days and nights.<sup>♱</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    They were weak. First, impossible heat started to almost melt their skin. It was like volcanic lava sliming all over their body. Their eyes were barely open, shocked by the intensity of the light Apolonia couldn't see anything else than the inside. It stopped moving. Before there was some floating, the pressure — now only emptiness. They were lying like this, holding the belly tight with barely conscious hands. The time stretched in a feverish sweat. Guards saw them throwing up and shaking and couldn't help. No other ghoul ever saw something like this in their lives. All they did was watch Apolonia's slow melt into subconsciousness. Their eyes closed forever. The body became cold and as volcanic lava froze in nothingness.
	                The first Ghoul in history died that day. The town lived on in silence. Half of it didn’t  even know what happened, while the other half just wondered in silence. A hostile takeover became a  disappearance. Who knew, stayed shut.<sup>♱♱</sup>

				    <sup>♱</sup> In 2016 there were two bills submitted to the lower house of parliament. The first one called "Stop Abortion” tightens the abortion law, providing for imprisonment of illegal abortion both for the person doctor and the mother. The second one called "Let’s Save Women” was submitted as a response, which supports unlimited abortion until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy. The first bill against freedom of choice was submitted for further consideration while the other bill immediately rejected after the first reading. People in many cities across the country went in the streets to demonstrate, which ended up in rejecting the "Stop Abortion” bill. Nationwide dispute over abortion was not over    though. 
                    On 22nd of October 2020 Constitutional Court ruled that it is illegal to terminate the pregnancy even in the event of the fetus is in a high probability of severe and irreversible impairment. That meant that pregnant women who had previously undergo a medical process of allowing for termination of pregnancy due to severe damage to the fetus, were enable to do that.<sup>3</sup>
                    The scale of enormous demonstrations was widespread in international media which supported Polish women in the fight for their rights. Regime television in Poland condemned the protests while compared strike’s symbol of lightning to WW2 nazi symbol SS. 
                    That was an exceptionally emotional moment for me and all the people in my surrounding. Until today we fight for our freedom of choice, trying to break free from a constant control of men. Extraordinary solidarity among Polish people showed how much love we have each other. An expression "you will never walk alone again” became a Poland-wide slogan standing for empathy and support.

				    <sup>♱♱</sup> Year 2020 was also a year of the deepened anti-LGBT+ actions. The ruling party of Law and Justice was coming through an image crisis. The promised wealth clashed with reality where hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs and national health service was hardly making the ends meet. Instead of fixing already existing problems the ruling party created a new one to make a diversion. Still ongoing narrative is mostly based on alleged attack of LGBT+ people on "family” values.<sup>4</sup> "Let’s defend families from this kind of corruption, depravity, absolutely immoral behavior, let’s defend them from the LGBT ideology, and let's stop listening to these idiocy about some human rights or someones’ equality. These people are not equal to normal people, and let's end this discussion. Let's end the discussion of these LGBT abominations, homosexuality, bisexuality, parades. Let’s defend the family, because the lack of defense of the family leads us to what you see now.” said the party member Przemysław Czarnek who also soon later become a Minister of Education. Polish President Andrzej Duda only supported those statements and referred to a neo-Bolshevist movement. "They try to tell us that these [LGBT] are people, while in fact it’s only ideology” said in a public speech.	The move from words to deeds came shortly. There were many cases of public call out, death threats, abuse, beating, stone throwing and arson. Actions were also coming from families of people identifying as part of LGBT+ community, which resulted in many struggling from depression or suicidal thoughts.f This radical tactic of disrespect and dehumanization results in real tragedies which we witness even more often today.

                    <p>This thesis is written in self conscious fiction. That allows me to tell the underlying truth which is obscure and ugly. Two layers, which I operate in-between, allow me to obtain and share different views on liberation and resistance seen in many old and modern examples.
                    I was researching visual representations of vampirism in contemporary culture including pop culture artists like Lil Nas X. The use of fiction became a motivation for many artists like him but also became inspiration for my thesis and my future art practice. I also relied on my own experience. Growing up in 21st century Poland, a revolutionary space that faces not only global postmodern challenges and political changes, but also those characteristic for post-soviet countries, I have had the opportunity to gain such experience.
